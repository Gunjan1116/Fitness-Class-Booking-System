                    <h3>SUITABLE FOR</h3>
                    <p>Commercial Gyms – this is an effective workout that is often the most suitable for a commercial
                        gym, but not for home use, as the machine tends to be quite bulky in size. If you have the space
                        in your home, you can also have this machine, but many people try to do without it by using
                        different types of free weight, dumbbell or a barbell for a chest press.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>WHO SHOULD USE IT?</h3>
                    <p>The chest press machine allows you to increase the size and strength of your chest. Therefore if
                        you’re a bodybuilder, rugby player, football player, hockey player, martial artist, and
                        wrestler, this can be a good machine to add to your chest muscle and strengthen it. Basically,
                        if you take part in a sport or work in a profession that requires a lot of pushing and heavy
                        moving, this will benefit you.</p>

                    <h3>VERSATILITY RATING
                    </h3>
                    <p>We’d give this rating a 3/5 as you can only do the chest incline and decline. However, it does
